# Problem Domain

The Ministry of Health wants to collect data about what type of vaccine people took, what type of side effects or symptoms they had afterwards, and hard data from people who already experienced taking the vaccines. So that they can give general information to other countries.

So, The Ministry of Health wants to build an application that has a form where you can share your experience after taking a vaccine, a page to show statistics based on the information from the form, a general data tab about vaccines, a page where you can view the places where you can take vaccines, and a Quiz to test your knowledge about the vaccines in general.


# These sites are used to collect some information for this page general information
