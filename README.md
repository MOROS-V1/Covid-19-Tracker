# Problem Domain

Ministary of Health wants to collect data from people who took the vaccines to provide information about the symptoms of each type of vaccine they took and to prove to the people who are afraid or didn't take vaccine yet that it is okay to take vaccines with hard data from people who already experienced taking the vaccines and so that the Ministary of Health gives general infromation about vaccines to other countries.

So The Ministary of Health wants to build an application that has a form where you can share your experience after taking a vaccine and a page to show statistics based on the information from the form, a general data tab about vaccines, a page where you can view the places where you can take vaccines and a Quiz to test your knowledge about the vaccines in general.
