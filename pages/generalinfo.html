                <p>
                    There are several vaccines for COVID-19 that are undergoing clinical trials.
                    <br> The FDA will evaluate the results of these trials before approving the use of COVID-19
                    vaccines.
                    <br> But because there is an urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines,
                    <br> and because the FDA approval process can take anywhere from several months to several years,
                    <br> the FDA will issue an emergency use authorization.
                    <br> for COVID-19 vaccines based on less data than is usually required.
                    <br> Data must show that vaccines are safe and effective before the FDA can issue an emergency use
                    authorization.

                        <h3> fizer-Bioentech vaccine for COVID-19.</h3> The fizer-Bioentech vaccine is 95% effective in
                        preventing symptoms of COVID-19 infection in people 16 years of age and older.
                        <br> The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children aged 12 to 15 years.
                        <br> This vaccine is for people 12 years of age and older.
                        <br> It requires two injections, 21 days apart.
                        <br> The second dose may be given up to six weeks after the first dose, if needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Moderna Vaccine for Covid 19.</h3>
                        The Covid 19 vaccine produced by Moderna is 94% effective in preventing symptoms of the Covid 19
                        virus.
                        This vaccine is for people 18 years of age and older, and requires two injections 28 days apart.
                        The second dose may be given up to six weeks after the first dose, if needed.

                    <li>
                        <h3>Johnson & Johnson vaccine for COVID-19.</h3>
                        In clinical trials, this vaccine was 66% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection,
                        14 days after vaccination. The vaccine was also 85% effective in preventing severe COVID-19,
                        at least 28 days after receiving the vaccine. This vaccine is for people 18 years of age and
                        older, and requires one injection.
                        The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                        (CDC) have recommended continued use of this vaccine in the United States because the benefits
                        outweigh the risks.
                        If you take this vaccine, you should be educated about the potential risks and possible symptoms
                        of a problem involving blood clotting.

                        <h3> Sinopharm Vaccine Against COVID-19</h3>
                        The SAGE recommends the use of BIBP in two doses and WHO advises an interval of 3 to 4 weeks
                        between the first and second doses.
                        If the second dose is given less than 3 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be
                        repeated.
                        A large, phase 3, multi-country trial showed that two doses, 21 days apart, were 79% effective
                        against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 days or more after the second dose.
                        The effectiveness of the vaccine in avoiding the need for hospitalization was 79%.
                        It is not recommended to give the vaccine to people under 18 years of age before the results of
                        further studies in that age group are released

                        <h3> AstraZeneca Vaccine for COVID-19
                        </h3>
                        The efficacy of the vaccine is 70% (compared to more than 90% of the Pfizer-Biontech and Moderna
                        vaccines),
                        a percentage confirmed by the specialized magazine "The Lancet".
                        The vaccine was licensed in more than 70 countries until mid-March,
                        and Britain was the first country to agree to its use and order 100 million doses of it.

                    If you develop any signs of an allergic reaction, seek medical help immediately.
                    An allergic reaction could mean that you are allergic to the vaccine.
                    You may not be able to get a second dose of the same vaccine.
                    However, you may be able to get a different vaccine for the second dose.
                    It is not recommended to take pain relievers before getting the COVID-19 vaccine in order to prevent
                    possible discomfort.
                    It is unclear how these drugs affect the effectiveness of vaccines.
